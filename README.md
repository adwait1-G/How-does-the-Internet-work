# How-does-the-Internet-work?

An introduction to Computer Networks and Network programming

This is actually the material I had prepared to conduct a workshop for students in a nearby college, but the workshop didn't happen due to some reasons. 

I decided to put the material in public anyway.

1. The presentation has all the basics needed to get started.
2. After going through the presentation, go through the server and client python scripts and then run it!
3. Have fun!
