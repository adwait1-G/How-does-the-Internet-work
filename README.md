# How-does-the-Internet-work?

An introduction to Computer Networks and Network programming

This is actually the material I had prepared to conduct a workshop for students in a nearby college, but the workshop didn't happen due to some reasons. 

I decided to put the material in public anyway.

1. The presentation has all the basics needed to get started.
2. The **practicals** folder has simple client and server programs written in python. All the concepts needed is covered in the presentation. Run them and have fun!
